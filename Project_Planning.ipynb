    "\n",
    "- the webpages involve some level of interaction. most common is select a certain feature, and have it highlighted in a larger dataset.\n",
    "- these are a little different and have a video, which ours is not required to have per the *final webpage deliverables* but this might be nice to have as well. is pretty easy to do and is just like the presentation and a walk through of the page.\n",
    "- some visualizations do not really \"tell a story\". example is the tap water one where it is cool to see the data, but the average person does not really know what that means.\n",
    "- feel that the ones with a map element are the most compelling, since there is a chance the user can more easily relate to it. they can find their location on the map, and see what data is like there and how it compares."
